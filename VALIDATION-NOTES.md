# Validation notes — accepted deviations

This file records guideline checks the team has reasoned through and
accepted as the right outcome for this component. The
`/validate-web-component` validator (and the individual triad
validators) read this file on every run; entries here downgrade the
matching `❌ Fail` verdicts to `✅ Pass` (or `⚠️ Exception`) and remove
the items from the punch-list.

Each section is headed with the affected check ID(s) and explains
*why the deviation is correct for this component*. A note that reads
like a deferral ("fix later", "low priority") will be ignored by the
validator — those belong in the actual fix queue, not here.

Consumer-facing limitations (things integrators need to know about)
live in `README.md → ## Known Limitations`, not here. This file is
internal/technical.

## C-BV-9 — Strategy A signal-override pattern

The 21 `var(--base-*)` reads the auto-script flags outside
`variables.css` all live in `src/css/dark-mode.css:25-60`. They are
**variable redeclarations inside `:host-context(...)` / `:host(...)`
override selectors** — the canonical "Strategy A" dark-mode pattern
documented in
`guidelines/web-components/color-scheme.md` → "Two strategies for
framework-class & per-instance signals":

```css
:host-context([data-theme="dark"]) {
  --drp-dropdown-bg: var(--base-dropdown-bg, var(--base-elevated-bg, #1a1a1a));
  --drp-border-color: var(--base-border-color, #3a3a3a);
  /* ... */
}
```

This is a `--<prefix>-*` declaration that *reads* `--base-*` to keep
the consumer's cross-component theming hook intact while overriding
the literal fallback for the dark scope. It is NOT a feature-rule
read that bypasses the two-layer pattern (which is what C-BV-9
exists to catch).

The C-BV-9 auto-script doesn't distinguish "variable declaration
inside an override selector" from "feature-rule `var(--base-*)`
read"; for Strategy A components the auto-script over-flags.

## C-CST-4 / C-CST-10 — Logic-class module split

The auto-script flags 16 service-to-service imports. These are not
independent Service classes — they're one Logic class
(`DateRangePicker`) organized across files for maintainability:

- `src/date-picker.ts` — main class, holds state, public surface
- `src/date-picker-validation.ts`
- `src/date-picker-rendering.ts`
- `src/date-picker-navigation.ts`
- `src/date-picker-selection.ts`
- `src/date-picker-interaction.ts`
- `src/date-picker-ui.ts`
- `src/date-picker-locales.ts`

The collaborators are imported as namespaces
(`import * as Validation from './date-picker-validation'`) and the
main class delegates through wrapper methods:

```typescript
// src/date-picker.ts:2284
startDrag(event, type, dayElement) {
  return Interaction.startDrag(this, event, type, dayElement);
}
```

The collaborators are not independently consumable — none can be
lifted into another package without the main class's state object
threaded through every call. None of the Bliss Service-class
properties (single-purpose, independently consumable, brokered by
the Logic class) holds. They are functionally the Logic layer split
across files.

The Bliss component-structure guideline currently only documents
single-file Logic classes and independent Service classes. This
pattern (namespace-style Logic-class file split) isn't named.
Until the guideline is updated to recognize it, C-CST-4 produces a
false positive here.

C-CST-10 also flags the folder shape as deviating from the canonical
`<feature>.ts` single-file Logic class. Same rationale.

## C-CS-10 — Tooltip portal in standalone JS-class path

The auto-script for C-CS-10 needs human judgment to classify tooltip
code paths (in-shadow / portal / native). This component has two
usage modes with different tooltip behavior:

**Web-component path (the typical case) — Kind A, in-shadow.**
The Element class (`src/web-component.ts:474`) passes
`container: this.shadow as unknown as HTMLElement` into
`new DateRangePicker(...)`. That value flows through to
`this.containerElement` (`src/date-picker.ts:164`) and ultimately to
`new Tooltip(buttonElement, text, { container })` for action-button
tooltips (`src/date-picker.ts:831`) and
`this.containerElement.appendChild(this.tooltip)` for day-cell
tooltips (`src/date-picker.ts:1223`). All tooltip DOM lives inside
the shadow root, so the dark-mode signal selectors
(`:host([data-theme="dark"])`, `:host-context(...)`) reach them and
the `--drp-tooltip-*` variables resolve via the standard chain.

**Standalone JS-class path — Kind B, document.body fallback.**
A consumer using
`new DateRangePicker(inputElement, { /* no container */ })` directly
gets `containerElement = document.body` (the `|| document.body`
fallback in `src/date-picker.ts:164`). Tooltips then live in light
DOM and don't inherit the shadow-scope dark-mode flip. This is the
documented standalone-path behavior; consumers using this path can
pass an explicit `container` option to opt back into shadow scope.

The Kind-A path covers the primary use case (web-component). The
Kind-B path is the standalone fallback and consumers using it know
they're bypassing the custom-element infrastructure. Both paths
behave correctly for the OS / page-level `color-scheme: dark` signal
(via `light-dark()` and the `:host, :root` dual declaration); only
the per-instance / framework-class dark signals are shadow-scoped.

## C-CSS-7 / C-NC-8 — Consumer-data discriminator classes

Five of the six BEM-flagged classes (`.holiday`, `.event`,
`.badge-count`, `.badge-number`, `.badge-text`) are not
component-emitted — they're consumer-data values applied via the
`dayClassMember` / `badgeClassMember` callbacks. The component
ships compound selectors (`.drp__day.holiday`,
`.drp__badge-cell.badge-count`) as default styling for the common
consumer conventions, with the actual BEM block (`.drp__day`,
`.drp__badge-cell`) on the left of every compound.

The full rationale is in `README.md → ## Known Limitations` (it's
also consumer-facing — integrators need to know about the
convention). Repeated here so the validator can find the check IDs.

## C-NC-6 — *Member fields paired with unified getDateMetadataCallback

Seven `*Member` attributes on `DatePickerOptions` expose the
attribute-driven, property-name-extraction API for consumer data
objects:

- `badgeClassMember`, `badgeTextMember`, `badgeTooltipMember`
- `dateMember`
- `dayClassMember`, `dayTooltipMember`
- `isDisabledMember`

The C-NC-6 auto-script expects each `*Member` to pair with a
per-field `get*Callback` (e.g., `getBadgeClassCallback`). For this
component the programmatic peer is the **unified
`getDateMetadataCallback`**, which returns a `DateInfo` containing
all seven values in one call per day. The pattern is intentional:
per-field callbacks would force seven function calls per day cell
(quadratic in date-range pickers with many visible days) and would
duplicate the data-shape logic on the consumer side. The single
unified callback is the canonical extraction surface for this
component.

The auto-script flags the absence of the per-field callbacks; the
unified callback satisfies the spirit of the check.
